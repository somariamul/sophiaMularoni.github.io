### Robotics
```markdown
I have made many RC robots as a hobbyist as well as worked on more complex systems such as the 
robot from my RBE1001 class. In my intro to robotics course, I worked with 2 CS majors to 
create an autonomous robot that picks up objects and delivers them. From these experiences I 
have gained proeficiency in CAD and CAM software, as well as C++ and 3D printing.
